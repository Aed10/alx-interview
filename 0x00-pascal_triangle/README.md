# Pascal's Triangle

This project involves generating Pascal's Triangle, a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number is the sum of the two directly above it.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Usage

To generate Pascal's Triangle, run the following command:

```bash
python3 pascal_triangle.py
```

## Example

For `n = 5`, the output will be:

```
[
    [1],
    [1, 1],
   [1, 2, 1],
  [1, 3, 3, 1],
 [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
```
